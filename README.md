# Simple Blockchain Simulation

A basic blockchain simulation in Python created to learn the fundamentals of blocks, hashing, mining, and consensus mechanisms.

This project covers:
- Creating a `Block` class and linking blocks into a chain.
- Simulating Proof of Work mining with a nonce.
- Demonstrating how tampering breaks the chain's integrity.
- Simulating PoW, PoS, and DPoS consensus mechanisms.

## Code Files

* `block_simulation.py`: Demonstrates the creation of a basic chain and the effect of tampering.
* `mining_simulation.py`: Simulates the Proof of Work mining process.
* `consensus_simulation.py`: Simulates three different consensus mechanisms.
